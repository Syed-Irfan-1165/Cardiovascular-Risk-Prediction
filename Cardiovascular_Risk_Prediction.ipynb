The goal is to provide a personalized risk score for each individual, allowing healthcare providers to intervene and prevent or mitigate the disease.\n",

        "The model will take into account factors such as age, gender, family history, smoking, hypertension, obesity, physical inactivity, high cholesterol levels, and diabetes. The project will address the challenge of accurately quantifying the contribution of each factor to the overall CVD risk and taking into account the complex interplay between these factors. The solution will be scalable, easily interpretable, and able to handle missing data.\n",

        "The end result of this project will be a predictive model that can be used by healthcare providers to prioritize their interventions and improve the outcomes for individuals at high risk of CVD. The model will have the potential to have a significant impact on public health by reducing the incidence of CVD and improving the lives of those affected by the disease."
